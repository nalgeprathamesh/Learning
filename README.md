🚀 Why I Built This Repository
As a self-driven learner, I needed a central space to track my progress, reflect on concepts, and maybe even help someone else starting their CS journey.
This repo is like my open-source brain dump — a mix of structured notes, code experiments, and creative projects.

🧠 “Not perfect. Always learning. Forever shipping.”

📌 Current Focus
✅ Completed
CWH Python – Mastered conditional programming concepts

Mini Project – Built a “Secret Agent ID Generator” in Python

📺 YouTube Channel – My old channel still pulls in 25K+ views/month! Planning a fresh new channel focused on AI, DS & coding soon!

📝 The transparency.md structure was a personal initiative I started on 23/05/2025 to keep my learning honest and trackable.

“The best way to learn is to build and reflect.”
— Me, navigating the chaos one commit at a time 😄
