🚀 Why I Built This Repository
As a self-driven learner, I needed a central space to track my progress, reflect on concepts, and maybe even help someone else starting their CS journey.
This repo is like my open-source brain dump — a mix of structured notes, code experiments, and creative projects.

🧠 “Not perfect. Always learning. Forever shipping.”

📌 Current Focus

“The best way to learn is to build and reflect.”
— Me, navigating the chaos one commit at a time 😄
