# 📘 **LEARNING JOURNAL REPO** 🧠

Welcome to my personal knowledge hub — a digital brain-dump of everything I’m learning in computer science, programming, and self-development.

This repo exists as a **trackable logbook**, **reflection space**, and maybe even a **helping hand** for someone just starting out on their CS journey.

---

## 🚀 Why I Built This Repository

As a **self-driven learner**, I needed a central place to:

- Track my progress 📈  
- Reflect on concepts 💡  
- Stay consistent and accountable 📌  
- And hopefully help others along the way 🤝

This is not just a bunch of notes — it’s my **open-source learning companion**, full of structured writeups, hands-on experiments, and real takeaways from the trenches.

> 🧠 *“Not perfect. Always learning. Forever shipping.”*

## 🎯 Current Focus

### ✅ **Completed**

- **CWH Python**  
  Mastered conditional programming concepts, loops, functions and recursions, and Python basics.

- **Mini Project**  
  Built a fun little project: `Rock, Paper , Scissors`(Latest) using Python 🕵️

---

### 🛠️ **In Progress**

- **📓 Chapter 8 Notes**  
  Documenting functions and recursion programming notes on Notion in my own words.

- **Upcoming Mini Projects**  
  Planning more hands-on builds to reinforce core logic.

## 🧾 Transparency & Honesty

> 📝 I started using a personal `transparency.md` format on **23/05/2025**  
> This file keeps each project accountable by documenting:
> - Whether it was AI/tutor-assisted
> - What tools were used (VS Code, Notion, etc.)
> - What I struggled with and learned from

It’s not just about finishing — it’s about learning **deliberately** and **honestly**.
