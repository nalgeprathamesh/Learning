# The same set from the set theory in class 11
# Sets is a collection of well defined non repeating objects
s = {1,2,3}
e = set() #This is used to create empty set bcz e = {} gives empty dictionary
# Set doesnt allow duplicate elements so it wont consider them
# Sets are unordered and unindexed
