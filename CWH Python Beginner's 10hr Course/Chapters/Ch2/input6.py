a = int(input("Enter Number 1: "))
b = int(input("Enter Number 2: "))
print("The sum of these numbers is :" , a+b)

# NOTE - IF WE DONT ADD INT DATATYPE OUTSIDE OF INPUT , then a and b will be considered STRINGS and when
# we will add them then it will give output like 1+2=12 Because the strings will concatinate
