# Transparency.md

This is the transparency log for the CodeWithHarry Python course.

## 📜 Transparency Log  
### Code Ownership Breakdown

- ✅ **Fully written by me**  
  - All practice problems  
  - Solved projects  
  - Most code was written with 95%+ accuracy on the first try. I reviewed
    and occasionally improved it after comparing with the tutor’s version
    when I spotted bugs or better approaches.

- ⚙️ **AI-assisted**  
  - All notes are AI-assisted. I upload code, problems, and theory,
    and use AI to help organize it into well-structured Notion notes.  
  - Some project problem statements were generated using AI,
    but the solutions are fully written by me.  
  - I’ve also asked AI clarifying questions (e.g., how `pyttsx3` works),
    but never used AI to directly write core logic.

- 👨‍🏫 **Tutor-guided / Course-based**  
  - All lessons are based on CodeWithHarry’s Python course. The base logic is taught by Harry Sir,
    but I write and test everything myself as part of my learning.  
  - Some projects were given as part of the course but were completely solved independently by me.
    In some cases, I reviewed the tutor’s version afterward to improve code efficiency.

## 🧠 Final Note

This repository is part of my self-learning journey.  
I'm committed to learning honestly and deeply, so I’ve documented all external help or tools used.  
**No shortcuts — just real learning, real progress.**
